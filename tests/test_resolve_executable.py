"""Tests for how the build path re-invokes itself under sudo.

Two bugs are guarded here:

1. The launcher path was once derived from __file__, assuming a `bin/shelley` sibling of
   the package. False under a `uv tool install` layout, where the launcher lives in
   .../uv/tools/shelley/bin/ while the package lives in .../site-packages/shelley/.
   resolve_shelley_executable resolves via PATH instead.
2. A PATH lookup can resolve to a *different installation* than the one running. With a
   system-wide shelley present, `uv run shelley build` in a checkout re-exec'd the system
   copy, so the privileged half of the build ran older code — silently installing to the
   wrong place while the unprivileged half printed the new version's output.
   reexec_command re-runs the current package via `sys.executable -m shelley`.
