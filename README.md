# Shelley

**A bioinformatics tool finder and module builder for CVMFS-hosted containers on [BioShell](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/bioimage)**

Shelley helps researchers using [BioShell](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/BioShell) virtual machine images on Nectar research cloud platforms discover, query, and deploy bioinformatics software from CVMFS (CernVM File System) repositories. It provides both interactive and programmatic interfaces for finding tools, building Lmod modules, and managing containerised workflows.

## Features

- **Tool Discovery**: Find bioinformatics tools by name or search by description
- **Container Management**: Query available container versions from CVMFS
- **Module Building**: Automatically generate Lmod modules for tools, individually or in batch
- **Interactive CLI**: Guided REPL for exploring and installing tools

## Quick Start

### Installation

`shelley` ships with [BioShell](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/BioShell).

To install or update shelley manually:

| Goal | Guide |
|---|---|
| Install/update on a workstation, VM, or BioShell image | [docs/how-to/install.md](docs/how-to/install.md) |
| Developer environment | [docs/how-to/developer-setup.md](docs/how-to/developer-setup.md) |

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Find a specific tool
shelley find fastqc

# Search by function (in development)
shelley search "quality control"

# List available versions
shelley versions samtools

# Build an Lmod module
shelley build samtools

# Build a specific version
shelley build samtools/1.21

# Interactive mode
shelley interactive
```

## Architecture

Shelley is organised as a modular Python package:

```
shelley/
├── client/          # CLI entry point (thin routing)
├── commands/        # One module per user-facing command
├── builder/         # CVMFS module building functionality
├── script/          # Run-once to generate cached data
├── search/          # Tool metadata search sources
└── utils/           # Shared utilities, cache, rendering, style
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Access to CVMFS repositories (typically `/cvmfs/singularity.galaxyproject.org/`)
- Lmod (for module management)
- Singularity/Apptainer (for container execution)
