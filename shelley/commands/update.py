"""Self-upgrade: run the correct ``uv tool upgrade`` for this install.

shelley is installed exclusively from git via ``uv tool`` (see
docs/how-to/install.md), and the exact upgrade command differs by install mode:

- **system-wide** — installed under ``/opt/uv/tools`` for every user on the VM;
  upgrading needs ``sudo``, the ``UV_TOOL_DIR``/``UV_TOOL_BIN_DIR`` overrides, and
  uv's absolute path (``sudo`` resets ``PATH``).
- **per-user** — installed under ``~/.local``; a plain ``uv tool upgrade`` works.

``shelley update`` detects which one applies from where this package lives, then
runs ``uv tool upgrade shelley`` (uv re-resolves the recorded ``git+…@branch``
source). Output streams straight through so uv's progress — and any ``sudo``
password prompt — is visible to the user.
