"""Permissions for the shared build layout.

Build artifacts are written by root (the build path re-execs under sudo) but must be
readable and executable by every user on the machine. Two layers get us there:

1. ``apply_build_umask`` — set the process umask before any subprocess runs, so
   everything shpc creates is 0755/0644 from birth. Necessary because sudo unions the
   caller's umask with the sudoers default, so a user with ``umask 077`` would
   otherwise produce 0700 directories inside /apps.
2. ``harden_tree`` — an explicit chmod pass over the subtrees a build touched, for
   directories that already existed under a stricter umask, or were created by a
   direct ``shpc`` call outside shelley.

Everything here is best-effort except ``ensure_shared_dir``, which propagates so that
a failed bootstrap is loud rather than producing a half-shared install.
