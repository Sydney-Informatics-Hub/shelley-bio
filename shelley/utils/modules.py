"""Environment (Lmod) module loading for the build path.

BioShell provides shpc and singularity as Lmod modules that must be loaded before
use. This helper loads them into the current process environment so subsequent
subprocess calls (shpc, and singularity via container-guts) inherit an environment
where those tools are on PATH.

It is called ONLY from the build path (shelley.commands.build.build_module) so that
read-only commands (find, search, versions) remain uvx-able on non-BioShell systems
and never touch the module system. On hosts without Lmod, or if the load fails, it
warns and continues, relying on whatever shpc/singularity are already on PATH.
